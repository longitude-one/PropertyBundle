# In all environments, the following files are loaded if they exist,
# the latter taking precedence over the former:
#
#  * .env                contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
#  * .env.local          uncommitted file with local overrides
#  * .env.$APP_ENV       committed environment-specific defaults
#  * .env.$APP_ENV.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
#
# Real environment variables win over .env files.
#
# DO NOT DEFINE PRODUCTION SECRETS IN THIS FILE NOR IN ANY OTHER COMMITTED FILES.
#
# Run "composer dump-env prod" to compile .env files for production use (requires symfony/flex >=1.2).

# This is used by docker to name your container
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my_bundle

# APP_SECRET environment variable is required to generate CSRF tokens and will be used by docker.
# By default for symfony/framework-bundle generates one when it's installed via Symfony Flex.
# If you do not use Flex, make sure to change your APP_SECRET =.
# The default value is ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt , change it.
APP_SECRET=ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
